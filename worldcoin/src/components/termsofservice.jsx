      <p className="terms-introduction">
        Welcome to Worldcoin. These Terms between you and Tools for Humanity Corporation, a Delaware corporation (‚ÄúWorldcoin,‚Äù ‚Äúwe,‚Äù or ‚Äúus‚Äù), govern your use of and access to Worldcoin‚Äôs websites and applications, and all of the associated functionality, content, applications, and services we provide to you (collectively, the ‚ÄúServices‚Äù). Please read these Terms carefully before using or accessing the Services. By accessing or using any of the Services we provide, you expressly agree to be bound by these Terms and by our Privacy Statement, which is incorporated as a part of these Terms.
      </p>
      <p className="terms-important">Please note two especially important parts of these Terms:</p>
      <ul className="terms-important-list">
        <li>Dispute Resolution; Arbitration and Waiver of Class Action: You agree to resolve any disputes between you and Worldcoin through binding arbitration rather than in court. Please review the section below titled ‚ÄúDispute Resolution; Arbitration and Waiver of Class Action‚Äù for details.</li>
        <li>Investment Disclaimer: Nothing in the Services constitutes an offer to sell, or the solicitation of an offer to buy, any securities. The Services do not constitute investment advice. Holding, buying, or selling Worldcoin tokens (‚ÄúWLD‚Äù) or any other digital currencies may not be permitted where you live, and it is your responsibility to comply with all applicable laws. Please consider whether buying, selling, using, or holding digital currencies, including WLD, is suitable for you in light of your financial circumstances and your understanding of digital currencies. The value of WLD and other digital currencies may change quickly and may lose all of their value. We do not guarantee that we will launch the Worldcoin network, that the Worldcoin network will operate as planned, or that WLD will have value.</li>
